% Base case: Sum of integers from 1 to 0 is 0
sum_integers(0, 0).

% Recursive case: Sum integers from 1 to N
sum_integers(N, Sum) :-
    N > 0,              % Ensure N is positive
    Prev is N - 1,      % Decrement N to get previous number
    sum_integers(Prev, PrevSum),   % Recursively compute sum for Prev
    Sum is PrevSum + N. % Sum is previous sum plus N
