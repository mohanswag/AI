% Define predicate to solve Towers of Hanoi
hanoi(N) :-
    move(N, left, middle, right).

% Base case: Moving 0 disks requires no action.
move(0, _, _, _) :- !.

% Recursive case: Move N disks from Source to Destination using Auxiliary as temporary
move(N, Source, Auxiliary, Destination) :-
    N > 0,
    M is N - 1,
    move(M, Source, Destination, Auxiliary),      % Move N-1 disks from Source to Auxiliary
    format('Move disk from ~w to ~w~n', [Source, Destination]),
    move(M, Auxiliary, Source, Destination).      % Move N-1 disks from Auxiliary to Destination
